This repo comes from the indigo branch of https://github.com/DLu/navigation_layers/tree/indigo without the navigation_layer and social_navigation_layer.
It's an updated version of the branch, working on ROS Kinetic.

# range_sensor_layer

I added some modifications from the issues and PR like the parameterization of transform_tolerance_, the fix of illegal bound warnings and the clearing of obstacles :
